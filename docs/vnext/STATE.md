# vNext working state

Updated: 2026-09-02

Read this first, then only the linked active material. The authoritative tracker
remains the [implementation plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#phase-8--openmw-desktop-vertical-slice).

## Current position

- Branch: `vnext`
- Phase 7: **Implemented**
- Phase 8: **In Progress**
- Slice 8.1: **Implemented**
- Slice 8.2: **In Progress** (OpenMW composition remains)
- Governing decisions: [ADR-0007](adr/ADR-0007-openmw-hook-patch-queue-policy.md),
  [ADR-0047](adr/ADR-0047-phase8-adapter-lifecycle-and-provider-boundary.md),
  [ADR-0048](adr/ADR-0048-canonical-revision-and-simulation-tick-separation.md)
- Latest implementation commit: `906cfc809a` (`Separate canonical revision from simulation tick`)

## Working synopsis

The complete Slice 7.6 implementation and real two-client process proof pass;
the project owner accepted the implementation demo on 2026-09-02.
Same-pump closes use one bounded canonical batch; disconnect captures current
canonical progress; resume preserves identity, generation progression, revision,
and acknowledgements; exact expiration rejects the old token and fresh join
creates a new identity. Credentials remain in memory and absent from evidence.

Slice 7.7 layered matrix, thresholds, and RSS-window rule are approved. The
bounded named profiles, seeded 10,000-tick matrix, paced 32-cycle reconnect,
queue high-water/zero-drain proof, and 60-second two-client real-process soak
pass replay, fault, convergence, identity/progress, matching-view, bounded RSS,
and queue contracts. An owner-approved two-pass application pump now coalesces
intermediate same-tick views before transport; the deterministic regression and
optimized lifecycle demo pass without weakening client contradiction rejection.
The project owner accepted the Slice 7.7 implementation demo and Phase 7 exit
gate on 2026-09-02. The owner approved the exact Slice 8.1 P8-001 through P8-003
hook inventory on 2026-09-02. Slice 8.2 two-provider architecture and
correct-then-command frame order are approved. The owner then approved breaking
Option D after caller migration exposed split orchestration ownership. The
runtime now owns protocol/session progression, binding/application, command
sequencing, bounded queues, and failure closure. The headless proof caller and
the concrete OpenMW coordinator core use that one path. Configuration-gated
executable attachment and the owner demo remain.

## Last verified

Fresh MSVC 19.51 Debug headless runtime, server-app, full protocol, and OpenMW
adapter contracts, all 120 Python tests, and the pinned FlatBuffers proof pass.
The real-process lifecycle proof passes movement, convergence, stale-view,
32-cycle reconnect, expiration, fresh identity, and zero final queue depth. Staged
baseline provenance passes with 299 intentional differences and 69 dependency
inputs; staged legacy exclusion, patch-registry verification, and diff checks
pass. A fresh MSVC 19.51 full configuration confirms the pinned Bullet 3.25
bundle uses double precision, and the RelWithDebInfo `openmw.exe` build passes.
